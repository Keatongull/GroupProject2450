To run this program just run the python file called main. The program is a small scale machine language simulator. It has 100 spots of memory in which it can store commands. You are either able to directly modify the memory or open a .txt file that has these instructions.

The GUI consists of a console, 6 buttons used to operate the program and a scrollable box that shows the spaces in memory.

The run button creates a memory object before working through the instructions in that memory.

The clear button isn't implemented yet.

The open button opens the file browser and lets you select a file with prebuilt instructions. This also loads the commands into the memory editor.

The save button will save changed memory instructions to a file.

The change theme button will prompt the user to input 2 hex color codes which will then change the GUI to those colors.

The exit button closes out the program.


NOTE: There are some mac compatability issues, for best results use windows
