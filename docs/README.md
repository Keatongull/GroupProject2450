To run this program just run the python file called main. The program is a small scale machine language simulator. It has 250 spots of memory in which it can store commands. You are either able to directly modify the memory or open a .txt file that has these instructions.

The GUI consists of a console, 7 buttons used to operate the program, a scrollable box that shows the spaces in memory, and another box that shows the current open files.

To switch between already opened files just click on the name of the desired file in the open files box.

BUTTONS
- The Run button creates a memory object before working through the instructions in that memory.
- The Clear Console button will clear the console of any text
- The Open File button opens the file browser and lets you select a file with prebuilt instructions. This also loads the commands into the memory editor.
- The Save Code button will save changed memory instructions to a file.
- The Edit Memory button will let you change a selected location in memory
- The Change Theme button will prompt the user to input 2 hex color codes which will then change the GUI to those colors.
- The Exit button closes out the program.


**NOTE: There are some mac compatability issues, for best results use windows**
