Code Inspection Checklist

1. Code Formatting and Style
    Is the code consistently formatted? No, we have been updating things to be in snake case to try to fix this
    Are naming conventions followed for variables, functions, etc? No, we have some functions/variables that need to be updated
2. Correctness and Completeness
    Are all algorithms implemented correctly? as far as implemented algorithms they all work but we have a few that still need to be implemented
    Are there any logical errors or incorrect assumptions?
| **3. Efficiency** |
| - Are there any unnecessary computations or redundant operations? |
| - Can any parts of the code be optimized for better performance? |
| **4. Error Handling** |
| - Are potential errors or exceptions handled properly? |
| - Is there appropriate input validation to prevent unexpected issues? |
| **5. Documentation and Comments** |
| - Is the code well-documented, explaining the purpose and logic of complex sections? |
| - Are all functions and modules accompanied by comments describing their behavior? |
| **6. Security** |
| - Are there any security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections or buffer overflows? |
| - Is sensitive data properly encrypted and secured? |
| **7. Portability and Maintainability** |
| - Is the code written in a way that it can be easily adapted or modified? |
| - Are there hard-coded values that could be replaced with variables or constants? |
